This is the base repository for COMP110 Worksheet 3.

Fork this repository, and edit `README.md` to show your pseudocode solving the worksheet task. Tip: use triple backticks to preserve spacing, e.g.:

```
Guesses Allowed = 4
Word is similiar = 0

	While running
		you choose a word from the list of words

	if word = false
	select new word from list
	
	if Word is similiar = 1
	then choose a word you think it is based on the amount of similiar letters you got

	if word = correct
	running = false

```
